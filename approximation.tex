\chapter{Appendix A - Approximations}

\section{VERTEX-COVER}

Create a copy of the edge list.  Choose an arbitrary edge from this
copy, and add both vertices on this edge to the set which will become
the vertex cover.  Then remove all edges in our edge list copy which
are incident to either vertex on the chosen edge.  Repeat this process
until our edge list copy is empty.

Exercise for the reader: prove that this is a 2-approximation.

\section{Bin Packing}

We describe the ``First-Fit'' approximation.  Given an object to pack
and a list of open bins, add the object to the first bin into which it
will fit.  If it fits into no bins, open a new bin and insert the object.

It should be easy to see that no two bins will be less than half full,
otherwise the object(s) in the second bin would have been added to the
first.

The worst case for this approximation is that every bin will be about
half full.  In which case it is no worse than twice the optimal, so
this is a 2-approximation.
