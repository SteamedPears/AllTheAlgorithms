\chapter{Minimum Spanning Tree}

Given an undirected, connected graph where each edge has positive
weight, return a connected subgraph on the same vertex set with
minimal weight.  This may not be unique, for proof consider two edges
with equal weight, either of which would connect two connected
components of a subgraph.  One but not both of these edges is in the
MST, but either would be minimum.

\section{Kruskal's Algorithm}

The idea of this algorithm is to begin with the vertex list and an
empty edge list, and maintain a forest adding the edge of minimum
weight that does not make a cycle until the forests are connected.
